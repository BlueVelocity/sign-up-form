## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Html was used to logically structure the content to make it 'tab friendly' and showcase the use of form specific semantic tags to make the page more screen reader friendly

Css code was incorporated to style the page and specifically showcase the use of pseudo classes and properly scaling web content based on viewport resolution. The css also showcases the proper segmentation of page content and use of background imagery to create a visually appealing page

Javascript was used sparingly to complement the built-in client side validation of the password fields to ensure they match before being submitted

## Optimizations

Further optimizations to the page could include more robust validation of the input fields, specifically the password and email fields, as well as ma more user friendly telephone field

Screen size could also be evalutated at load time ensuiing a more mobile friendly experienced is presented should the device demand it

## Lessons Learned:

Experience on this project furthered the understanding of flex box and relational scaling requirements, as well as form specific semantic tags and styling

As well, the importance of client side data validation was also underscored on this project as it's use will benefit the users experience and also reduce the round trip communication time required

This project also highlighted the importance of user experience for both able and impaired users and the accommodation of both parties
